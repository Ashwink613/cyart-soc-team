\# Cyart SOC Internship – Week 3 Submission



\## Overview

This folder contains the Week 3 SOC internship tasks focusing on advanced log analysis, threat intelligence integration, escalation workflows, evidence preservation, and full SOC workflow simulation.



The objective of this week was to strengthen Tier-1 SOC analyst capabilities by correlating logs, enriching alerts with threat intelligence, performing structured escalation, and documenting end-to-end incident handling.
