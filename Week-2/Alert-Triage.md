##### Alert Triage Overview



Alert triage is the process of analyzing, validating, and prioritizing security alerts generated by monitoring tools. The objective is to quickly identify true positives, reduce false positives, and escalate incidents appropriately.



This document demonstrates alert triage, prioritization, and threat intelligence validation.



###### Alert Triage Table

Alert ID	Alert Description	Source IP	Priority	Status

001	Phishing Email Detected	        192.168.1.10	High	     Escalated

002	Brute Force Login Attempts	192.168.1.100	Medium 	     Investigating

003	Port Scan Detected	        10.0.0.5	Low	     Closed



###### Triage Decision Explanation



Alert 001 (Phishing): Classified as High priority due to risk of credential theft and user impact. Escalated to Tier 2 for further investigation.



Alert 002 (Brute Force): Classified as Medium priority. Multiple failed attempts observed but no successful login detected.



Alert 003 (Port Scan): Classified as Low priority as it represents reconnaissance activity without active exploitation.



###### Threat Intelligence Validation



Threat intelligence was used to validate indicators associated with alerts.



###### Example validation:



Indicator: 192.168.1.100

Threat Intel Source: AlienVault OTX

Finding: IP previously associated with brute force activity

Conclusion: Alert confirmed as a true positive





Threat intelligence enrichment helps reduce false positives and supports accurate escalation decisions.



###### Outcome



Effective alert triage improves SOC efficiency by ensuring analysts focus on high-risk threats while minimizing unnecessary escalations.
